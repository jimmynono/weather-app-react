# Weather React App

Weather forecasting app, built with ReactJs. I used the OpenWeatherMap API for data, and created some logic to give the 5 day forecast. I folded in Redux as a learning tool, Redux may not be needed for this simple of an app, but allowed me an opportunity to improve my knowledge of Redux. Future iterations will include a full testing suite and more features.
